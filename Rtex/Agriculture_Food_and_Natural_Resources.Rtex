Figure \ref{fig1} shows the predominant level of education and training. The percentages reflect the number of occupations at each educational level within a pathway, not the number of workers. For example, the Restaurants and Food/Beverage Services pathway consists of twenty occupations: eighteen of them (90\%) require a bachelor's degree or more, and two of them (10\%) require an associate degree or some college. The predominant level of education for each occupation is determined by Trailblazers based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
